Oresund Bridge:
Decades in the planning and often controversial, the Oresund Bridge has quickly become a Scandinavian icon. 
The bridge is around ten kilometers from Copenhagen, and you can either drive across or take the train. On the Danish side, it starts out as a tunnel so as not to interfere with flights to and from adjacent Copenhagen Airport. 
The eight-kilometer structure opened in 1999 and now links the island of Zealand, Denmark's largest island and home to Copenhagen, to the southwest coast of Sweden, specifically to the port of Malmo, Sweden's third largest city. 
Fans of Scandi-noir will know that the Oresund Bridge has recently gained much global infamy as the central focus of the smash hit Danish/Swedish TV drama The Bridge.
